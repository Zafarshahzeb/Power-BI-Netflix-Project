# Power-BI-Netflix-Project
This Power BI project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the IMDb Movies and Shows dataset, which covers data from the past 70 years. The dataset includes information on runtime, ratings, votes, release years, and more, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of trends and insights in the entertainment industry.

Project Highlights Data Preparation:

Created a column to compute Score x Votes to evaluate overall impact. Added a runtime_hrs column to convert runtime from minutes to hours. Implemented slicers for runtime_hrs, release year, and type to facilitate dynamic filtering. Visualizations:

Donut Chart: Visualized the number of movies released each year (filtered for years after 2010). Pie Chart: Showcased the number of shows released each year (filtered for years after 2010). Scatter Plot: Demonstrated how the average of Score x Votes varies with runtime. Bar Chart: Displayed the number of movies in each age certification bucket since 2000. Combination Chart: Analyzed how Score x Votes varies with age certification and illustrated how age certification relates to average runtime in hours. Additional Features:

Added a card for displaying the title of movies or shows. Included a multi-row card for showcasing descriptions. Enhanced the dashboard with aesthetic improvements for better user experience.
